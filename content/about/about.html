						<h3>About me</h3>
						<img class="portrait-left small" src="./img/andreladeira.jpg" alt="André Ladeira">
						<p>Hi, I’m André Ladeira, programmer, engineer, husband and proud father of two. I’m the responsible for just about everything on this site.</p>
						<p>I’m passionate about technology since childhood but I’ve started programming only at the university, during my engineering graduation. For an engineer, programming is a necessary tool because most academical work in engineering follows a defined path: first  physical modelling and then computational numerical simulation and  processing of resulting data.</p>
						<p>I guess I’ve followed the path that most engineer-programers do: I’ve started with the basic things, got bit by the programming bug, and them taught myself the nice stuff. The first language I’ve learned was Pascal and I had a lot of fun with it. Soon, every task from every class was an excuse to do what I liked: code!</p>
						<p>Someday I discovered that the MS Windows API was built on C, UNIX was built on C and then, suddenly, C seemed to the be “the” thing professionals used (the power delivered  by Delphi/Object  Pascal was still a couple of years away…). Because of this epiphany I taught myself C during a summer break and right after that applied for a trainee position as a C programmer on a technology startup. I was lucky enough to get hired, and soon  was working coding real-time multithreaded application in a variety of UNIX and Windows environments.</p> 
						<p>This is how programminhg started and became a way of living for me. At this point in my career I’m more or less proficient in a handful of programming languages, from some basic assembler up to the web gang (html/css/php/js...), but C/C++ remained at the core of my career as a programmer.</p> 
						<p>I believe that to be both an engineer and a programmer is a privileged standpoint in the current technological era. Connecting these things has been the drive of my career in the last 15 years or so.</p>

						<h3>Why start a blog?</h3>
						<p>The  main reason behind the creation of this blog was a desire to consolidate some programming experiments in my own website. Here I can share code and ideas, receive feedback, criticism and,  hopefully, give something back to the amazing online programming community.</p>
						<p>Having a blog is also a powerful drive to improve my work,    by reviewing it in order to make it available and understandable (so I hope…).</p>
						<p>So, thanks for the visit, I hope you are enjoying whatever you found here!</p>
