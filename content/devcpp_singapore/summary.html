This morning, after revisiting some old persolnal projects I endded up wondering about what happened to the Dev-C++ initiative. For those among you that have no idea of what Iâ€™m talking about, the Dev-C++ is (was?) a very nice open source IDE for the MinGW C++ compiler. It attracted some attention around 2003/2005 and then vanished away, probably because it's development halted due to some personal reasons of the main programmer.
