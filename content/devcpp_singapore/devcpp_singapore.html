This morning, after revisiting some old persolnal projects I endded up wondering about what happened to the Dev-C++ initiative. For those among you that have no idea of what I’m talking about, the Dev-C++ is (was?) a very nice open source IDE for the MinGW C++ compiler. It attracted some attention around 2003/2005 and then vanished away, probably because it's development halted due to some personal reasons of the main programmer.

But what made this little trip to the past worth a post was something I bumped on while reading the wikipedia page for Dev-C++:

<div class="callout info">

	<p>On May 4, 2015, The Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong posted his Sudoku solver program in C++ on Facebook. In his screen shot, he's using Microsoft Windows and Dev-C++ as his IDE.</p>

How cool is that?<br>

Some countries have prime ministers that can build a sudoku solver in C++, using a very old IDE. Other countries have presidents that… well, nevermind.
